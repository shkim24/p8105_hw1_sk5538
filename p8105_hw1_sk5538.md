Necessary package and data set are loaded.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Problem 1

### Description of data

The Penguins dataset contains size measurements for 3 species of adult
foraging penguins observed near Palmer Station, Antarctica.

The size of the data set is 344 rows and 8 columns, in which the
variables are: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

Three different species, Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap were observed in 3
different islands. The sizes of the penguins were measured in terms of
bills, flippers, and weight. The mean flipper length is 200.915.

### Scatterplot

``` r
bill_flipper_plot <- ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Flipper Length vs Bill Length by Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)") 

print(bill_flipper_plot)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

```

## Problem 2

### Create a data frame

``` r
set.seed(123)
sample = rnorm(10)
log_vec = sample > 0 
char_vec = letters[1:10]
fac_vec = factor(rep(c("low", "medium", "high"), length.out = 10))

p2df = tibble(
  sample = sample,
  log_vec = log_vec,
  char_vec = char_vec,
  fac_vec = fac_vec
)
```

### Try to take the mean of each variable.

``` r
mean_sample = mean(pull(p2df, sample))
mean_log_vec = mean(pull(p2df, log_vec))
mean_char_vec = mean(pull (p2df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_fac_vec = mean(pull (p2df, fac_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2df, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Mean of random_sample: 0.07462564 
    ##  Mean of logical_vector: 0.5 
    ##  Mean of character_vector: NA 
    ##  Mean of factor_vector: NA

Taking the mean of random sample works because it has dlb, or double, as
its data type. This is a type of numeric data, so the mean can be
computed.

Taking the mean of logic vector also works, since logical values can be
coerced to numeric values (TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0).

However, taking the mean of character vector or factor vector does not
work. Because they are not numeric data, and the mean() function cannot
operate on them.

### Try applying as.numeric function

``` r
num_log = as.numeric(pull(p2df, log_vec))
num_char = as.numeric(pull(p2df, char_vec))
num_fac = as.numeric(pull(p2df, fac_vec))
```

For logical vector, as.numeric() converts TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0. This
explains why the mean of logical vector could be computed.

For the factor vector, as.numeric() assigns integers in order of the
levels in the factor. In the example above, ‘low’ = 2, ‘medium’ = 3, and
‘high’ = 1, which is not what the factor intended the order to be.
Instead, the values are assigned alphabetically. As the factor is
converted to its underlying integer codes, the assigned integers are not
meaningful. The mean() function does not coerce such conversion, so the
mean of a factor vector cannot be computed.

The character vector contains ‘chr’ data type. Any string or character
cannot be converted to numeric values. This also explains why the mean
could not be computed.
