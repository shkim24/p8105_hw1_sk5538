Necessary packages and dataset are loaded.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The Penguins dataset contains size measurements for 3 species of adult
foraging penguins observed near Palmer Station, Antarctica.

The size of the data set is344 rows and 8 columns, in which the columns
(variables) are: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

Three different species, Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap were observed in 3
different islands. The sizes of the penguins were measured in terms of
bills, flippers, and weight. The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

``` r
bill_flipper_plot <- ggplot(
  penguins, 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Flipper Length vs Bill Length by Species",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()

print(bill_flipper_plot)
```
